## L46, L47 Permutations
- Each time start from zero
- Keep track of whether the index has been used or not
- <b>Sort the numbers and use `i != 0 && nums[i] == nums[i-1] && !visited.contains(i)` to remove duplicate</b> => make sure we always use the more front one

## L48 Rotate Image
- Build coordinates such that original point is at upper-left corner.
- Use polar coordinates to get coordinates' relationship

## L49 Group Anagrams
- This problem is in essence about encoding of string. Two ways:
  - Encode string by sorting it
  - Encode string by count character and its occurrence times
- Some thing related to Java:
  - Note that we can't use `char[]` as key because `map.containsKey()` will call .equals on `char[]`. Even if the two char arrays contains
  exactly the same content they are not equal.
