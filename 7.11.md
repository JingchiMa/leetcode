## Combination Sum I II III IV
- DFS
  - Sort the Array!!!
  - Remove duplicates in the given array => `if (i != start && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue`
  - First check whether target == 0 or not, then check whether start >= length already
- DP
  - One dimension: target
  - This is different from knapsack problem because in this problem we consider differnt sequence as different solutions.
  Therefore there's no need to enforce an order:  each time we just search them all. But for knapsack problem, we have to enforce that 
  for the first i items, do what what what.
  

## L43 Multiply Strings
- Index starts from left to right! 
one digit is at index i of number1, and one is at index j of number2.(Note that index from left to right!) Then in the product, 
the digit will be at `i+j+1` and `i+j` (carrier) \
Think it this way:
i digit * j digit => `num1[i] * 10^(m - i-1) * num2[j] * 10^(n - j-1)` = `num1[i] * num2[j] * 10 ^ (m + n - 2 - (i+j))`
So on the right there are `i + j -2` digits \
If there are `m + n` digits in total(maybe `m+n-1` if there's no final carrier), then the digit index will be 
`(m + n - 1 - (m + n - 2 - (i+j))) = i + j + 1`. And thus for carrier the index will be `i + j `

- Don't forget to remove the leading zeroes if the product is not zero! (iterate over the leading zeroes seperately)
