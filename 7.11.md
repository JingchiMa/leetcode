## Combination Sum I II III IV
- DFS
  - Sort the Array!!!
  - Remove duplicates in the given array => `if (i != start && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue`
  - First check whether target == 0 or not, then check whether start >= length already
- DP
  - One dimension: target
  - This is different from knapsack problem because in this problem we consider differnt sequence as different solutions.
  Therefore there's no need to enforce an order:  each time we just search them all. But for knapsack problem, we have to enforce that 
  for the first i items, do what what what.
  

## L43 Multiply Strings
- Index starts from left to right! 
one digit is at index i of number1, and one is at index j of number2.(Note that index from left to right!) Then in the product, 
the digit will be at i+j+1 and i+j(carrier) \
