## L18 4Sum
- Remove duplicate in each level
- Follow up: 
  ## L454 4Sum II
  - The key difference is: 
    1. each number can only be chosen in seperate sets
    2. duplicates are allowed.
  - Some techniques:
    1. ` myMap.getOrDefault(key, 0)`
    2. No need to use two maps. Just create one map and then iterate through the other two arrays.

## L19 Remove nth node from the end
- Keep two pointers with offset = n
- To remove nodes, we need to keep track of the front node! So both fast and slow pointer should start from head instead of dummy node

## L22 Generate Parentheses
- if openNum < n, can add '('
- if closeNum < n, can add ')'

## L24 Swap Nodes in Pairs
- To use `fast.next != null`, you have to first check `fast != null`
- Steps as follows:
  1. front -> ptr -> ptr.next
  2. front.next = ptr
  3. store ptr.next into tmp
  4. ptr.next.next = ptr
  5. ptr.next = tmp
  6. Move forward front and ptr: 
    - front = ptr
    - ptr = front.next
    
    
## L29 Divide two integers # NOT FINISHED
- Each time choose the largest possible power of divisor. (power of divisor can be obtained by bit operation)
- 

## L31 Next Permutation (*IMPORTANT*)
- We are actually finding the next large number. To make the number larger than before, we have to make one digit larger. And to make the change as small as possible, we need the digit to be as right as possible. Since we can only get one number from right side to replace the current one (if get from left side, the digit we are chaning is even lefter), we can start from the right-most digit, if we see a descending (seen from right), that means the digit can be increased. That said, we have found the right-most digit which can be increased by right part of the array.
- To make the larger number as small as possible, we want to make the change in the digit as small as possible. So we can use binary search on right part of array to find the smallest number which is larger than the current digit.
- Finally we should sort the right part in ascending order to make it even smaller.
总结一句，要想把数字变大，必须把一个位变大。想让变化尽量小，有三点：1.让变化的位尽可能靠右 2. 让变化位的变化尽量小 3. 让右半部分变为升序

## L32 Search in rotated sorted array
- if `nums[mid] < nums[0] && target < nums[0]`, then should go right, otherwise go left
- Follow-up:
  ## L81 Search in rotated sorted array (contain duplicates)
  - When there are duplicates, in the case when [mid] == [start], we can't tell it's in left part or right part. So we can only move left or right pointer by 1. Therefore, in the worst case, time complexity is O(n)
