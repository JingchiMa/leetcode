## L18 4Sum
- Remove duplicate in each level
- Follow up: 
  ## L454 4Sum II
  - The key difference is: 
    1. each number can only be chosen in seperate sets
    2. duplicates are allowed.
  - Some techniques:
    1. ` myMap.getOrDefault(key, 0)`
    2. No need to use two maps. Just create one map and then iterate through the other two arrays.

## L19 Remove nth node from the end
- Keep two pointers with offset = n
- To remove nodes, we need to keep track of the front node! So both fast and slow pointer should start from head instead of dummy node

## L22 Generate Parentheses
- if openNum < n, can add '('
- if closeNum < n, can add ')'

## L24 Swap Nodes in Pairs
- To use `fast.next != null`, you have to first check `fast != null`
- Steps as follows:
  1. front -> ptr -> ptr.next
  2. front.next = ptr
  3. store ptr.next into tmp
  4. ptr.next.next = ptr
  5. ptr.next = tmp
  6. Move forward front and ptr: 
    - front = ptr
    - ptr = front.next
    
    
## L29 Divide two integers # NOT FINISHED
- Each time choose the largest possible power of divisor. (power of divisor can be obtained by bit operation)
- 

## L31 Next Permutation
- First swap last digit with the last one who is strictly smaller than itself. (This is to make sure the permutation increases) \
  **if no such element, try the 2 to last element, 3, ... etc**
- Then sort the i+1 to last in ascending order. (This is to find the smallest larger value) \
  A built-in method `Arrays.sort(array, startIndex, endIndex)` (note endIndex is exclusive)
