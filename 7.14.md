## L54 Spriral Matrix
- Method 1: Simulation
  - Boundary, how to update boundary, which dimension of boundary should we check. These 3 should be information stored in three arrays.
  - direction is itself a two dimensional array.
- Method 2: Layer by Layer
We can choose to write 4 for loops inside the outer loop instead of trying to integrate them into 1.
```java
while (...) {
  for (...) // got right
  for (...) // go down
  for (...) // go left
  for (...) // go up
}
```
